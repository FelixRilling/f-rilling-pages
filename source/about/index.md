Hi, I'm Felix.
I'm a software developer from Germany currently working as software developer at [Cryptshare AG](https://www.cryptshare.com/).
My main areas of interest as a developer are frontend development using the latest web technologies, making sites fast and accessible, or backend development with TypeScript or Java.
